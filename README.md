# chirk
A collection of free and open source softwares, similar to the GNU project.

#
# About
Currently, the project is very small (only one software is currently part of chirk), but more are being actively developed, and as those are finished they will be added.

#
# How to get chirk
Currently, I have no way to distribute precompiled versions of chirk, so you will probably have to build it yourself. If you are unable to do this, email me at <nerogeist1212@gmail.com> and I will try to provide a precompiled version for you. It may be a few days before you get a response.
